                    &nbsp; is just under 14 billion years old. From our position
                    in the Milky Way galaxy, we can observe a sphere that is now
                    about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery.
                    Wherever we look, the universe has an even temperature.

                    The universe is not old enough for light to have traveled
                    the vast distance from one side of the universe to the
                    other, and there has not been enough time for scattered
                    patches of hot and cold to mix into an even temperature.

                    &nbsp; At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to look
                    a mile in one direction. You see a coffee cup, and from the
                    amount of steam, you can estimate its temperature and how
                    much it has cooled.

                    &nbsp; Now turn around and look a mile in the other
                    direction. You see a similar coffee cup, at exactly the same
                    temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar
                    cup in every direction, you might want to look for another
                    explanation.

                    >&nbsp; There has not been enough time to carry coffee cups
                    from place to place before they get cold. But if all the
                    coffee cups were somehow filled from a single coffee pot,
                    all at the same time, that might explain their even
                    temperature.

                    <span class="grid-text-title">INFLATION</span>&nbsp; solves
                    this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a
                    trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the universe
                    expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the
                    violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the
                    large-scale structures of the universe.

                    Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient
                    fluctuations in swirls of polarized light in the cosmic
                    background radiation, which is energy left over from the
                    early universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by
                    Einstein.

                    Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot
                    expanding faster than light and cooling to an even
                    temperature as it expands. That is something like inflation.
                    And the structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam
                    of the original pot.
