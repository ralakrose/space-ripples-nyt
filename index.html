                CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
                physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s
                appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and
                equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some
                exotic particles that should have been created in the Big Bang.
                Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to
                begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic
                evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy
                that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell
                faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent
                instant.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why
                the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a
                jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all
                the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not
                missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the
                ocean.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the
                page and drew a double box around it.

                On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers
                reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and
                that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked
                right.

                Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to
                <a href="">the first silver of cosmic time</a> with telescopes
                at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of
                the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples
                in the fabric of space-time — so-called
                <a href="">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of a universe
                being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth
                of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the
                long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac
                and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.

                Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years,
                though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever
                be proved.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in
                science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy
                pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would
                open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and
                speculation.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see,
                extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of
                billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger
                cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable.
                Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless
                number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a
                pot of pasta water boiling over.

                In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
                operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
                accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity
                itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct
                observation of gravitational waves, which, according to
                Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle
                space-time.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe
                expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big
                as it gets.”
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe,

              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a
                bath of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a
                picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot
                as the surface of the sun.

              <p class="paragraph">
                Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known
                as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic
                Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at
                the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of
                papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.
