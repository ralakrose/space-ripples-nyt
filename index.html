                CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
                physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s
                appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and
                equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some
                exotic particles that should have been created in the Big Bang.
                Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to
                begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic
                evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy
                that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell
                faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent
                instant.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why
                the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a
                jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all
                the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not
                missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the
                ocean.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the
                page and drew a double box around it.

                On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers
                reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and
                that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked
                right.

                at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of
                the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples
                in the fabric of space-time — so-called
                <a href="">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of a universe
                being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth
                of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the
                long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac
                and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.

                Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years,
                though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever
                be proved.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in
                science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy
                pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would
                open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and
                speculation.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see,
                extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of
                billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger
                cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable.
                Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless
                number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a
                pot of pasta water boiling over.

                In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
                operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
                accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity
                itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct
                observation of gravitational waves, which, according to
                Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle
                space-time.

              <p class="paragraph">
                Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe
                expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big

              <p class="paragraph">
                The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a
                bath of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a
                picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot
                as the surface of the sun.

                In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the
                microwave radiation was polarized, meaning the light waves had a
                slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than
                another.

                This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the
                gravitational waves from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space
                in one direction and stretching it in another as they go by,
                would twist the direction of polarization of the microwaves,
                theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky
                should have little arrows going in spirals.

              <p class="paragraph">
                Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small
                differences in the temperature of the microwaves. The group’s
                telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting

                Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today:
                gravity, electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces.
                But they have long suspected that those are simply different
                manifestations of a single unified force that ruled the universe
                in its earliest, hottest moments.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a
                fall from grace, like some old folk mythology of gods or
                brothers falling out with each other. The laws of physics
                evolved, with one force after another splitting away.

                Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as
                the temperature falls below 32 degrees, until it is disturbed,
                at which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified
                state too long. In that case, space itself would become imbued
                with a mysterious latent energy.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act
                as a kind of antigravity, and the universe would blow itself up.
                Since it was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the
                more space was created, the harder it pushed apart.

                inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our own universe
                settled down to a comfortable homey expansion, the rest of the
                cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off other bubbles
